Practice python
---------------

This project contains my python and ipython code, materials. **You may not need
this, nor this can help you with any of your problems.** But if you're also
interesting with Python and IPython, feel free to use my source code.

I choose Python as the main programming language to use when reading algorithm
books. This dues to the fact that Python is widely used and supported in
scientific progrmaming. Also, after sometime working mainly with Java, I want to
learn a scripting/dynamic language.
