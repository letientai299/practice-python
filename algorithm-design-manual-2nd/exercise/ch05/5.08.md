Assuming `n` vertices and `m` edges.

# Convert from an adjacency matrix to adjacency lists
For undirected graph, we only need to care about upper right half of the matrix.
For directed graph, we need to process full matrix. Loop through each row to
build the adjacency list for a single node. The time complexity is
`O(log(n^2))`.



# Convert from an adjacency list to an [incidence matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_matrix)

Naive solution. Loop through the list of edges. `O(log(m))` time. For each edge,
fill 2 cell in the incidence matrix.


# Convert from an incidence matrix to adjacency lists

Again, just a naive solution. For each node, loop through `m` columns to find
the edge. This will take `O(log(nm))` time.

For undirected graph, we can speed up a little bit by update both 2 connected
list as once, and clear for relevant cells. So that, next time, the second node
doesn't need to care about processed edge.
