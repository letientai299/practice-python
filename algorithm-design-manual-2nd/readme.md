This folder contains Jupyter note books and Python implementation for
some algorithms described in the book [The algorithm Design Manual,
2nd](http://www.algorist.com/) by Steven Skiena.

In the beginning I want to solve as much problems as I can, actually, I
aimed to everything. But I don't have enough time. So, here you can find
only the solution, implementation for things that interesting me. Also, there's
some note (about math) that may help you when reading the book and do exercises.
