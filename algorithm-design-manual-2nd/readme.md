This folder contains Jupyter note books and Python implementation for
some algorithms described in the book [The algorithm Design Manual,
2nd](http://www.algorist.com/) by Steven Skiena.

In the beginning I want to solve as much problems as I can, actually, I
aimed to everything. But I don't have enough time and I'm not be smart
enough to solve some problems. So, here you can find only the solution,
implementation for things that interesting me. Also, there's some notes
(about math) that may help you when reading the book and do exercises.
